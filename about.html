  <h2>About the Author</h2>
  <p>Hi, I'm Andrew Winder, and I write here about technologies that I encounter
    in my day-to-day work, as well as comment on interesting news about the industry
    in general. I also post links to articles &amp; projects that I'm working with
    or that I find interesting, and that I think others might find interesting too.
    I might even use this site to talk about my own open-source projects one day,
    if I can manage to actually drive any to completion!</p>
  <p>A little bit about who I am: I'm a Node.js &amp; AngularJS web developer currently
    working at <a href="http://www.messagesystems.com/">Message Systems</a> in
    Columbia, MD. I've been working full-time in the tech industry for the last
    6 years, but I fell in love with the Web and started programming against it around
    13 years ago. I started out my career primarily working with JavaScript &amp; PHP,
    while working with the Drupal Content Management System. I built a couple of
    high-traffic sites using that platform, from the <a href="http://www.wfp.org/">World
    Food Programme</a> to the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">2008 WhiteHouse.gov
    redesign</a> along with a very talented team of developers. Later I worked for
    <a href="http://www.npr.org">NPR.org</a>, again doing a lot of JavaScript development
    alongside PHP.  I worked on some <a href="http://www.npr.org/infiniteplayer/">fun projects
    </a> while I was there, and I worked on a small sub-team to reimplement parts of
    the backend &amp; frontend code in the responsive redesign of <a href="http://www.npr.org">
    NPR.org</a>. I also started working with Node.js on some smaller projects around
    that time, and started getting into MVVC JavaScript frameworks like
    <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout.js</a> as well.</p>
  <p>I'm now working with a lot of newer technologies in my work at Message Systems,
    utilizing an all-javascript stack with Node.js on the backend and AngularJS on the
    frontend. I'm writing automated tests (unit &amp; functional), and using task
    runner tools like <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> to automate common tasks
    and build steps. I'm working with a lot of non-RDBMS data stores like
    <a href="http://www.vertica.com/">Vertica</a>, <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">
    ElasticSearch</a>, and <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a> lately,
    as the software I'm writing moves more into the space of needing to scale outside
    of smaller clusters or single machine instances.</p>
  <p>If any of this sounds interesting, these are the kinds of topics I plan on writing
    about on this site, so welcome to The Attic! Feel free to reach out to me on
    GitHub, LinkedIn, or Twitter if you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>This site uses the following open-source components, and could not exist without them:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Twitter Bootstrap</a>, a CSS framework that
    makes it easy for even a lowly developer like me to turn out something that looks
    halfway decent.</li>
    <li><a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a blogging-centric static site
    generator. This series of HTML pages is organized much nicer behind the scenes,
    check it out at <a href="https://github.com/awinder/awinder.github.io">github</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>, for deploying this site and
    other excellent convenience features when working with a Jekyll site.</a>
    <li><a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a>, an icon font that I use to provide some small
    graphics and the social networking icons.</li>
    <li><a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, for some of the Twitter Bootstrap
    built-ins.</li>
    <li><a href="http://prismjs.com">Prism.js</a>, for code highlighting blocks.</li>
    <li><a href="http://dharmatype.com/dharma-type/bebas-neue.html">Bebas Neue Font</a>,
      for the text in the title bar of the site.</li>
  </ul>
